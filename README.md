# Purpose
Just a little game to practice your geography skills. Try to select the correct outline of each African country.

# Translations
Do not directly modify the files in `/locales` unless you are adding new text to the app in English. Instead, translators and reviewers should visit the [Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/renes-open-source-projects/geoquiz) and request a role on the language you'd like to contribute to.

# Outlook
Enhance the game to the whole world. Add selector to play only a single continent. Create highscore list.
