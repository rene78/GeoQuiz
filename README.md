# Purpose
Just a little game to practice your geography skills. Try to select the correct outline of each country.

# Translations
## All text on the page (except countries and regions)
Do not directly modify the files in `/locales` unless you are adding new text to the app in English. Instead, translators and reviewers should visit the [Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/renes-open-source-projects/geoquiz) and request a role on the language they would like to contribute to.
## Countries and regions
Country names already have translations into major languages and do not have to be added manually. Regions and provinces however need to be manually translated. Go to [countryNames.js](https://github.com/rene78/GeoQuiz/blob/e0b502d95dd9bb7ec01db57fd886838cedb21dd2/locales/countryNames.js#L254) and enter the translations as you see fit.
